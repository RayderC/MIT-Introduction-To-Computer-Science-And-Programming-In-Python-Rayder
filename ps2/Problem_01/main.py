             Keep in mind that in hangman when a letter is guessed, all the positions
             at which that letter occurs in the secret word are revealed.
             Therefore, the hidden letter(_ ) cannot be one of the letters in the word
             that has already been revealed.

    Starts up an interactive game of Hangman.
    
    * At the start of the game, let the user know how many 
      letters the secret_word contains and how many guesses s/he starts with.
      
    * The user should start with 6 guesses
    
    * Before each round, you should display to the user how many guesses
      s/he has left and the letters that the user has not yet guessed.
    
    * Ask the user to supply one guess per round. Make sure to check that the user guesses a letter
      
    * The user should receive feedback immediately after each guess 
      about whether their guess appears in the computer's word.

    * After each guess, you should display to the user the 
      partially guessed word so far.
      
    * If the guess is the symbol *, print out all words in wordlist that
      matches the current guessed word. 
    
    Follows the other limitations detailed in the problem write-up.
